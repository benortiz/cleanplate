		<h2>Why 7 tasks? Why 7 days?</h2>
		<p>The 7 tasks automatically expire after 7 days to make sure your list and your mind don't get cluttered with things you aren't going to do. However, there is the option to save one task indefinitely. This task will stay at the top of your list to encourage you to finish it. Besides, 7 is a lucky number, right?</p>
		<h2>Where do I log-in?</h2>
		<p>There is no need to log in because everything is saved directly to the computer you're using.</p>
		<h2>Why is there no sync capability?</h2>
		<p>People spend too much time fidling with their devices compared to actually completing their tasks. The hope is 7 tasks are easy enough to remember and will encourage a more conscious to-do list experience.</p>
		<h2>Where did my tasks go?</h2>
		<p>If you're using another computer, you won't find your tasks there (see why there is no log-in above). Otherwise, they are on the computer where you left them.</p>
		<h2>Where can I see past tasks I have completed?</h2>
		<p>Stop worrying about the past! Get on with the present!</p>
		<h2>How was this made?</h2>
		<p>After years of using every form of a to-do list there was, I noticed a pattern. My to-do list would grow until it became so cluttered that I would never look at the list again. I hoped there was something out there to help solve this problem, but there wasn't.</p>
		<p>I soon realized I could create this new idea for the perfect to-do list app. I drew some quick mock-ups (<a href="TodoList.png">here</a> and <a href="TodoList-Annotated.png">here</a>) and asked <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3559928" target="blank">Hacker News</a> for help.</p>
		<p>Making this dropped off my radar for a good while until I saw my friend, <a href="http://about.me/asarroyo" target="blank">Alex</a>, learning Javascript from <a href="http://codecademy.com" target="blank">Codecademy</a>. I became re-energized and began to learn from Codecademy myself. My first idea was to use cookies (how websites remember if you're logged-in) to store tasks, but that fell through and I had to do a full rewrite using localStorage (meaning your tasks will stay on the computer you create them on). It's extra cool because there is no way I could ever find out about your tasks.</p>
		<p>In total, it took me about a week to finish this, including learning everything. Along the way, I had constant support and guidance from my girlfriend, <a href="http://about.ms" target="blank">Danielle</a>, regarding design and functionality. Thanks to her support, I finished.</p> 
		<h2>Can I format my task?</h2>
